Week 01 - Code Review : My First Website - Blog Homepage


Here you can see my first Website for the very first week of CodeReview. 

Is composed by four html pages: Home (index), About, Blog and Contact.

I styled the Home page as well as the Header and Footer in style.css.
Everything else is styled in the linkedPages.css file!
